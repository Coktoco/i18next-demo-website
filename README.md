# i18next Demo Project

This project is a demonstration website designed to showcase the core functionalities of **i18next**, a popular internationalization library for JavaScript. The website is also enhanced with **GSAP's ScrollTrigger** for smooth and interactive scroll-based animations and **Prism.JS** for highlighting code in a simplified and efficient way.

## Project Overview
This project serves as an interactive and educational platform, demonstrating how to use i18next for basic translation, interpolation, pluralization, and formatting within a website. It provides practical code examples and explanations, enabling developers to understand how to set up i18next and implement various localization features in their projects.

Additionally, GSAP's ScrollTrigger is used to create seamless and captivating scroll-based animations, enhancing the user experience. Prisma is integrated to handle code hightlighting.
## Features
- **Basic Translation**: Demonstrates the setup and usage of i18next for displaying translated content based on selected language.
- **Interpolation**: Shows how to insert dynamic content into translations (e.g., user names, ages).
- **Pluralization**: Illustrates handling singular and plural forms based on dynamic count values.
- **Formatting**: Demonstrates date and currency formatting within localized content.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects and sets the user's preferred language.
- **Scroll-triggered Animations**: Engaging animations triggered by scrolling, powered by GSAP's ScrollTrigger.
- **Data Management with Prisma**: Efficient handling of database queries and interactions for scalable data-driven content.

## Technologies Used
- **i18next**: Core library for internationalization and localization.
- **GSAP**: Animation library for high-performance animations.
- **ScrollTrigger**: A GSAP plugin for creating animations based on scroll positions.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM used to interact with the database in a type-safe way.
- **Tailwind**: A css library/framework.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies used to build the frontend.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
